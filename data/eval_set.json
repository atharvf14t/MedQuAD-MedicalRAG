    "question": "What are the symptoms of Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 2 ?",
    "answer": "What are the signs and symptoms of Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of lipid metabolism 90% Diabetes mellitus 90% Hepatomegaly 90% Insulin resistance 90% Lipoatrophy 90% Multiple lipomas 90% Round face 90% Skeletal muscle hypertrophy 90% Acute pancreatitis 75% Abnormality of the nail 50% Advanced eruption of teeth 50% Secondary amenorrhea 50% Thin skin 50% Abnormality of complement system 7.5% Acanthosis nigricans 7.5% Cellulitis 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Coronary artery disease 7.5% Cranial nerve paralysis 7.5% Glomerulopathy 7.5% Hepatic steatosis 7.5% Hypertrichosis 7.5% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% Myalgia 7.5% Myopathy 7.5% Polycystic ovaries 7.5% Splenomegaly 7.5% Toxemia of pregnancy 7.5% Adipose tissue loss - Atherosclerosis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Decreased subcutaneous fat - Enlarged peripheral nerve - Hirsutism - Hyperglycemia - Hyperinsulinemia - Hypertension - Hypertriglyceridemia - Hypoalphalipoproteinemia - Increased adipose tissue around the neck - Increased facial adipose tissue - Increased intraabdominal fat - Increased intramuscular fat - Insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus - Labial pseudohypertrophy - Loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue in limbs - Loss of truncal subcutaneous adipose tissue - Prominent superficial veins - Xanthomatosis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",

    "question": "What are the treatments for Acute respiratory distress syndrome ?",
    "answer": "How might acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) be treated? Typically people with ARDS need to be in an intensive care unit (ICU). The goal of treatment is to provide breathing support and treat the cause of ARDS. This may involve medications to treat infections, reduce inflammation, and remove fluid from the lungs. A breathing machine is used to deliver high doses of oxygen and continued pressure called PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) to the damaged lungs. Patients often need to be deeply sedated with medications when using this equipment. Some research suggests that giving medications to temporarily paralyze a person with ARDS will increase the chance of recovery. Treatment continues until the patient is well enough to breathe on his/her own. More detailed information about the treatment of ARDS can be accessed through the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and Medscape Reference. An article detailing Oxygen Therapy is also available.",

    "question": "What is (are) Juvenile retinoschisis ?",
    "answer": "Juvenile retinoschisis is an eye condition characterized by impaired vision that begins in childhood and occurs almost exclusively in males. The condition affects the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. This affects the sharpness of vision. Central vision is more commonly affected. Vision often deteriorates early in life, but then usually becomes stable until late adulthood. A second decline in vision typically occurs in a man's fifties or sixties. Sometimes severe complications occur, including separation of the retinal layers (retinal detachment) or leakage of blood vessels in the retina (vitreous hemorrhage). These can lead to blindness. Juvenile retinoschisis is caused by mutations in the RS1 gene. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Low-vision aids can be helpful. Surgery may be needed for some complications.",

    "question": "What is (are) Hansen's disease ?",
    "answer": "Hansen's disease (also known as leprosy) is a rare bacterial infection that affects the skin, nerves and mucous membranes. After exposure, it may take anywhere from 2 to 10 years to develop features of the condition. Once present, common signs and symptoms include skin lesions; muscle weakness or paralysis; eye problems that may lead to blindness; nosebleeds; severe pain; and/or numbness in the hands, feet, arms and legs. Hansen's disease is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae; however, the way in which the bacterium is transmitted (spread) is poorly understood. It appears that only about 5% of people are susceptible to the condition. Hansen's disease is easily treated with combination antibiotics for 6 months to 2 years.",

    "question": "What is (are) Chiari Malformation ?",
    "answer": "Chiari malformations (CMs) are structural defects in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance. When the indented bony space at the lower rear of the skull is smaller than normal, the cerebellum and brain stem can be pushed downward. The resulting pressure on the cerebellum can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (the liquid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord) and can cause a range of symptoms including dizziness, muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems, headache, and problems with balance and coordination. Symptoms may change for some individuals depending on buildup of CNS and any resulting pressure on tissue and nerves. CMs are classified by the severity of the disorder and the parts of the brain that protrude into the spinal canal. The most common is Type I, which may not cause symptoms and is often found by accident during an examination for another condition. Type II (also called Arnold-Chiari malformation) is usually accompanied by a myelomeningocele-a form of spina bifida that occurs when the spinal canal and backbone do not close before birth, causing the spinal cord to protrude through an opening in the back. This can cause partial or complete paralysis below the spinal opening. Type III is the most serious form of CM, and causes severe neurological defects. Other conditions sometimes associated with CM include hydrocephalus, syringomyelia (a fluid-filled cyst in the spinal cord), and spinal curvature.",

    "question": "What causes Aquagenic pruritus ?",
    "answer": "What causes aquagenic pruritus? The exact cause of aquagenic pruritus is unknown, but increased mast cell degranulation (release of granules rich in histamine and other compounds into the body by mast cells, a special type of cell that plays a role in the immune system), increased circulating histamine, release of acetylcholine (a chemical in the body which sends signals from nerves to muscles and between nerves in the brain), and increased skin fibrinolytic activity (activity that controls clot size by promoting the breakdown of clots) have all been named as possible causes of the condition. In some cases, it appears to be a symptom of polycythemia vera.",
